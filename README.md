## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, peer to peer learning, with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. 
The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the selection process for becoming a 42's student.

## Hard Skills

```
# Shell
	The first days of piscine are focused on learning shell commands 
	to know how to navigate through the terminal.
  
# C Language
	It is the primary language learned at the piscine: 
	creating functions and programs, dealing with variables, pointers and arrays.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, 
	which demands students to learn the system.
```

## Soft Skills

```
# Self-learning
	At 42, there are no teachers whatsoever; 
	the learning process is based on googling and enquiring your classmates.
  
# Teamwork
	In a peer to peer environment you learn the importance of your classmates; 
	you can count on them and they can count on you to push towards the same goal.
  
# Resilience
	You have to learn to "swim" throughout the massive load of work 
	demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
```
