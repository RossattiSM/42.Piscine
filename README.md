# C Piscine - 42 Málaga
This repository contains the projects I made during the 42 Málaga C Piscine Bootcamp, from Oct/17/2022 to Nov/11/2022.

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, peer to peer learning, with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. 
The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the selection process for becoming a 42's student.

## Hard Skills

```
# Shell
	The first days of piscine are focused on learning shell commands to know how to navigate through the terminal.
  
# C Language
	It is the primary language learned at the piscine: creating functions and programs, 
	dealing with variables, pointers and arrays.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to learn the system.
```

## Soft Skills

```
# Self-learning
	At 42, there are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling and enquiring your classmates.
  
# Teamwork
	In a peer to peer environment you learn to be aware of the importance of your classmates, 
  that you can count on them and also they can count on you to work together and push towards the same goal.
  
# Resilience
	You have to learn to "swim" throughout the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
```
